﻿/****** Installation Instructions ******

1. Update the Layout

Open the /Views/_ViewStart.cshtml
Change the Layout to _Foundation.cshtml like the example below:

@{
    //This is the default MVC template
    //Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";
    
    //This is the Foundation MVC template
    Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Foundation.cshtml";
}

2. Remove the default theme

Once the ViewStart has been updated. Replace the default Index.cshtml:

Rename ~/Views/Home/Index.cshtml to Index.cshtml.exclude (or delete the file)
Rename ~/Views/Home/Foundation_Index.cshtml to Index.cshtml

Replace the default style:

Rename ~/Content/Site.css to Site.css.exclude (or delete the file)

3. Automatic Bundling and Minification

Open the /App_Start/BundleConfig.cs
Add the following bundles:

            #region Foundation Bundles
            //If your project requires jQuery, you may remove the zepto bundle
            bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/zepto").Include(
                    "~/Scripts/zepto.js"));

            bundles.Add(new StyleBundle("~/Content/foundation/css").Include(
                       "~/Content/foundation/foundation.css",
                       "~/Content/foundation/foundation.mvc.css",
                       "~/Content/foundation/app.css"));

            bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/foundation").Include(
                      "~/Scripts/foundation/foundation.js",
                      "~/Scripts/foundation/foundation.*",
                      "~/Scripts/foundation/app.js"));
            #endregion
